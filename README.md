# Remote Under Water Surveillance Boat Project
 I have done this project as my microprocessor lab project. I built a boat which is capable of video transmission under water, sensing water temperature , turbidity, PH , environment humidity, air pressure etc. Those data is sent to thinkspeak web server through esp32s
